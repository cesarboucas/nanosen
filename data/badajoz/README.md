Part 1. Ozone levels by 2B Technologies model 202 ozone sensor vs Reference Instrument
Scope
The following is a description of the enclosed Excel documents that contains experimental data collected from low-cost sensor and reference instrument exposed to ambient air in Badajoz, University Campus, during research activities developed by our group “Environmental Chemical Analysis” at Universidad de Extremadura. 
Instruments and methodology
-Description of the sensor: The Model 202 Ozone Monitor (Figure 1) is designed to enable accurate and precise (±1.5 ppb) measurements of ozone ranging from a few ppb to 250,000 ppb (0-250 ppm) based on the well-established technique of UV absorbance at 254 nm. The Model 202 is lightweight (5.5 lb, 2.5 kg) and has a power consumption of only ~7 watts. It has been certified by the US-EPA as a Federal Equivalent Method (FEM).

-Description of the reference instrument: Model 42i-BZMTPAA, Thermo. It is a standard certified UV absorption ozone analyser (Figure 2, right side of the rack, second instrument from the top).

-Description of the experimental campaign: parallel measurement of ozone levels as hourly averages, from 21/09/2017 to 25/09/2017. Experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 3. The low-cost sensor was placed inside the wood shelter at the left of the image, it was operated at ambient temperature. The reference instrument was placed inside the monitoring unit at the centre of the image, it was operated at 20 ºC.
